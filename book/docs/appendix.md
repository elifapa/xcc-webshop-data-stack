### Troubleshooting Tips

Here are some common issues you might encounter and tips on how to resolve them:

#### Docker Issues

- **Containers Not Starting:** Check the logs of the containers using `docker logs <container_id>` to identify any errors.
- **Port Conflicts:** Ensure that the ports used by your containers are not already in use by other services.

#### dbt Issues

- **Model Failures:** Check the dbt logs for detailed error messages. Ensure that your SQL syntax is correct and that all dependencies are met.
- **Environment Configuration:** Verify that your `profiles.yml` file is correctly configured for each environment.

#### GitHub Actions Issues

- **Workflow Failures:** Check the logs of the failed workflow runs to identify the cause of the failure. Ensure that all required secrets and environment variables are set.
- **Self-Hosted Runner Issues:** Ensure that the self-hosted runner is online and has the necessary permissions to execute the workflows.

### Best Practices

Here are some best practices to keep in mind while working on your data analytics stack:

- **Version Control:** Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage your code and collaborate with team members.
- **Documentation:** Document your code, workflows, and configurations to make it easier for others to understand and maintain.
- **Testing:** Write and run automated tests to ensure the quality and reliability of your code.
- **Security:** Implement security best practices to protect your data and infrastructure.

### Glossary

- **CI/CD:** Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, a set of practices for automating the integration and deployment of code changes.
- **dbt:** Data Build Tool, a command-line tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform data in their warehouse more effectively.
- **Docker:** A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
- **GitHub Actions:** A platform for automating workflows directly within your GitHub repository.
